 *
 * This file was created to define functions and ports associated
 * with the Arduino Mega IO shield used to interact with main.c.
 * In includes four functions. The first, shield_io_init, initializes
 * the DDRs and PORTs to define correct inputs for the pushbuttons,
 * toggle switches, and LEDs. The toggle switches have a very unorthodox
 * connection to PORTE and PORTD from arduino pins 2-5, requiring both
 * ports to be set to the same to function as intended. The second function
 * is Read_PB, which simply reads the values from PINB and returns the values
 * within variable "data". The pushbuttons used utilize negative logic, so the
 * read in data was inverted before being returned from the function. 
 * The third function is Read_TS, a functin that utilizes the macro 
 * CHECK_BITIO() (detailed in shieldIO.h) to read the bits in the correct 
 * order, then shifting them to create a 4 bit sequence that can be returned
 * as variable "data". The final function is Set_LED, which simply outputs
 * its parameter "LED" of type uint8_t to its associated ouput port PORTA.
 *
