	MOD 800 Counter
	
	This program is a counter that will begin at 0 and count up
	to 799, an increment of 800, then output a serial value from an output
	bus. This counter was created in order to count through the 800
	columns found on a 800 x 526 pixel display via a VGA cable. There
	are two inputs and two outputs. For inputs, EN functions as an enable
	pin where the counter will pause when not high, and clock is a clock
	input that determines the counting speed. For outputs, CO is used as
	a clock input on a MOD 525 counter to switch rows, and counter[] is
	an output array that increases as the counter counts up.
