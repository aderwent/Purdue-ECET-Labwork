These programs (exe files) allow a user to select and download a hex file into an Arduino MEGA 2560 development board outside the Arduino IDE.
Requires a new (updated) version of the AVRdude programmer.  


Below appears to be the correct sequence of commands to invoke the process to download to an Arduino MEGA:

avrdude.exe -F -v -p ATmega2560 -c wiring -P\\.\" & cbbCOMPorts.Text & " -b 115200 -D -Uflash:w:" & TextBox4.Text & ":i"



Unzip these files into a local folder and run the Purdue ECET MEGA Arduino Uploader.exe file.  

Navigate to find the proper HEX file, select the comm port that matches the Arduino MEGA board, and click on the "Upload" button!  

If all goes as it should, a command prompt style window will open and the output of the Avrdude program should be visible.  
Upon completion, the command prompt should close automatically.
