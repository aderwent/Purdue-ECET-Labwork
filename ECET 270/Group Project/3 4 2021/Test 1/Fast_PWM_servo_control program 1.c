/*
This is a test program designed to allow testing of PWM control over RC servo motors.
 
 The program is written for the ATmega328P running at 16MHz.

 
 The program takes advantage of Fast PWM mode #14.  Mode 14 utilizes the ICR1 register to control the "TOP" of the PWM counter.
 This mode of operation allows the TOP of the PWM to be set to any value desired up to 65535.  This feature allows the frequency 
 to be controlled to a much tighter tolerance.
 
 For this example, the 16MHz clock is divided by 8 to produce a PWM clock source of 2MHz.  
 At 2MHz, it takes 20,000 ticks to produce the 10mSec (value for 100Hz) period to control the motor so ICR1 is set to 20,000.
 Note: at 2Mhz, each tick is 0.5uSec or to state it alternatively, the value loaded for a specific time delay in uSec must be multiplied by 2 ie. OCR1A = 1500 x 2;
